# OneDimensionAnimationPane
Sense Extension-One Dimension Navigation/animation Panel

This is a Qlik sense extension which enables navigation/autoplay along selected field-original or calculated.

The sole purpose of this extension is to simplify the process of selecting certain field in sequence.

When I do data expoloration, often I got annoyed by Qlik's selection mechanism. For example, to browse through monthly report for a year, I will have to create a month table and click every single column in sequence. It is such a pain in the eyes and I hate it especially when I click on the wrong column. This has interrupted my thinking process uncountable times. 
Maybe there are clever walkarounds on this issue but I couldnt find it online. So I build this extension to help myself, and people suffering in similar situation.
